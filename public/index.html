        <h1>Sami Ghasemi | Dark Mode Toggle App</h1>
        <p>
            I am Sam Ghasemi

            I was born in Iran I am fourteen years old now.
            I started programming when I was thirteen years
            old and I have gained a lot of experience and
            knowledge since that day. I am very interested
            in memorization. My main specialty is the web,
            but I have many other specialties that I do
            not want to do in the rest of my specialties.
            I also study economics, chemistry and physics.


            I am not completely fluent in English. Of course,
            I studied Japanese for almost four years, but
            now I do not speak Japanese at all, I do not
            even practice. I also had many problems in life.
            I am currently producing programming content and
            I am looking for a good job.
